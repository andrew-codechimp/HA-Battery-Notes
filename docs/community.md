### Battery State Card
Using the excellent [Battery State Card](https://github.com/maxwroc/battery-state-card) by maxwroc you can easily display devices with their batteries required where the devices battery threshold indicates it's low and show be replaced.

```yaml
type: custom:battery-state-card
secondary_info: '{attributes.battery_type_and_quantity}'
round: 0
filter:
  include:
    - name: entity_id
      value: '*_battery_plus'
  exclude:
    - name: attributes.battery_low
      value: false
bulk_rename:
  - from: "Battery+"      
sort:
  - state
```

## Automations

### Battery Low Notification
Raise a persistent notification when a battery is low, dismiss when it's not low

```yaml
alias: Battery Low Notification
description: Battery Low Notification with auto dismiss
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: battery_notes_battery_threshold
    event_data:
      battery_low: true
    id: low
    alias: Battery went low
  - platform: event
    event_type: battery_notes_battery_threshold
    event_data:
      battery_low: false
    id: high
    alias: Battery went high
condition: []
action:
  - choose:
      - conditions:
          - condition: trigger
            id:
              - low
        sequence:
          - service: persistent_notification.create
            data:
              title: |
                {{ trigger.event.data.device_name }} Battery Low
              notification_id: "{{ trigger.event.data.device_id }}"
              message: >
                The device has a battery level of {{
                trigger.event.data.battery_level }}% {{ '\n' -}} You need {{
                trigger.event.data.battery_quantity }}x {{
                trigger.event.data.battery_type }}
      - conditions:
          - condition: trigger
            id:
              - high
        sequence:
          - service: persistent_notification.dismiss
            data:
              notification_id: "{{ trigger.event.data.device_id }}"
mode: queued
```

### Battery Replaced
Mark a battery as replaced when there is an increase in battery level.

```yaml
alias: Battery Replaced
description: Battery Replaced
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: battery_notes_battery_increased
condition: []
action:
  - service: battery_notes.set_battery_replaced
    data:
      device_id: "{{ trigger.event.data.device_id }}"
mode: queued
```

## Automation Tips

To call the battery replaced service from an entity trigger you will need the device_id, here's an easy way to get this

```yaml
action:
  - service: battery_notes.set_battery_replaced
    data:
      device_id: "{{ device_id(trigger.entity_id) }}"
```

## Blueprints

[Blueprints](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/using_blueprints/) are an excellent way to get you up and running with the integration quickly. They can also be used as a guide for setting up new automations which you can tailor to your needs. 

### Battery Threshold
[Install blueprint](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fandrew-codechimp%2FHA-Battery-Notes%2Fmain%2Fdocs%2Fblueprints%2Fbattery_notes_battery_threshold.yaml) | [Source](./blueprints/battery_notes_battery_threshold.yaml)

This blueprint will allow notifications to be raised and/or custom actions to be performed when the battery threshold is met.
It is extended from the example Battery Low Notification automation yaml above for those who'd prefer an easy way to get started.


### Battery Replaced
[Install blueprint](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fandrew-codechimp%2FHA-Battery-Notes%2Fmain%2Fdocs%2Fblueprints%2Fbattery_notes_battery_replaced.yaml) | [Source](./blueprints/battery_notes_battery_replaced.yaml)

This blueprint will automatically update the battery replaced sensor and custom actions to be performed when the battery increases.
It is extended from the example Battery Replaced automation yaml above for those who'd prefer an easy way to get started.
