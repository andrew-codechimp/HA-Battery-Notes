# Entities

You'll get the following entities for each device you have added to battery notes.

## Battery+
`sensor.{{device_name}}_battery_plus`

An enhanced battery sensor that duplicates the normal battery but with additional attributes specific to battery notes, Battery+ sensors are only added device type battery notes that have a battery percentage sensor, see below for adding a battery percentage if your device does not have one.  
Use the battery+ sensor on dashboards with secondary information fields/templates etc to display battery notes specific details along with the battery level.  
The original battery can optionally be hidden by adding a [configuration setting](./configuration.md).

See how to use this entity in the [community contributions](./community.md)

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `battery_quantity` | `int` | The quantity of batteries |
| `battery_type` | `string` | The type of batteries |
| `battery_type_and_quantity` | `string` | The type of batteries with the quantity if more than 1 |
| `battery_last_replaced` | `string` | The date and time the battery was last replaced |
| `battery_low` | `bool` | An indicator of whether the battery is low based on the device or global threshold |
| `battery_low_threshold` | `int` | The device or global threshold for when the battery is low |
| `battery_last_reported` | `datetime` | The datetime when the battery level was last reported |
| `battery_last_reported_level` | `float` | The level when the battery was last reported |
| `device_id` | `string` | The device_id of the device |
| `device_name` | `string` | The name of the device |
| `source_entity_id` | `string` | The entity_id the battery note is associated with |

### Adding a battery percentage
If your device does not have a battery percentage but does have a battery voltage or other indicative sensor you can create a helper to add a calculated percentage. Battery Notes will create the Battery+ sensor from this. You can create the helper as follows   

- Within Settings > Devices & Services > Helpers press Create Helper
- Select a Template helper
- Select Template a sensor
- Give the template a name of MyDevice Battery (ensuring MyDevice exactly matches the name of the device will drop the device name from the Device sensors view and just show battery)
- The state template should reference the sensor and return a percentage  
Example of voltage sensor with a maximum capacity of 3 volts   
```{{ (states('sensor.my_sensor_voltage')|float(0) / 3 * 100) | round(0) }}```  
Example of low sensor, returning either 100% or 10%  
```{{ 10 if states('binary_sensor.my_sensor_low')  == true else 100 }}```  
- Unit of measurement should be %
- Device class should be battery
- State class should be measurement
- Device should be the device you want the template associated with (this is important otherwise Battery Notes will not find the helper)
- Save the helper 
- Within Settings > Devices & Services > Integrations > Battery Notes find the device you added the template to and click on the 3 dots and select Reload
- You will now have a Battery+ sensor for this device

!!! info

    You must create the template via a helper for it to be associated with the device.  YAML templates do not have the ability to be associated.


## Battery Type
`sensor.{{device_name}}_battery_type`

The battery quantity and type display in an easy to use single entity.  The quantity is only shown if more than 1.

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `battery_quantity` | `int` | The quantity of batteries |
| `battery_type` | `string` | The type of batteries |

## Battery Last Replaced
`sensor.{{device_name}}_battery_last_replaced`

The last time the battery of the device was replaced.

## Battery Replaced
`button.{{device_name}}_battery_replaced`

A button to set the battery_last_replaced entity to now.

## Battery Low
`sensor.{{device_name}}_battery_plus_low`

A boolean sensor indicating if the battery is low, true when the battery is below the device or global threshold.

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `battery_low_threshold` | `int` | The device or global threshold for when the battery is low. |
