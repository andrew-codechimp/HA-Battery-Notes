Integration to add battery notes to a device or entity, with automatic discovery via a growing [battery library](library.md) for devices.  
Track the battery type, when the battery was replaced, when a battery is low based on device or global thresholds and also when a battery hasn't been reported for a while.  

**Dashboard cards usage**

A battery+ sensor provides useful attributes for easy use in dashboards, the standard battery can optionally be hidden.  

**Notifications and automations**

Battery low, replaced and not reported are all exposed via events and actions, using these you can create your own automations to generate notifications or other actions, there are some predefined ones in [community](https://andrew-codechimp.github.io/HA-Battery-Notes/community).

## Acknowledgements

A lot of the inspiration for this integration came from the excellent [PowerCalc by bramstroker](https://github.com/bramstroker/homeassistant-powercalc), without adapting code from PowerCalc I'd never have worked out how to add additional sensors to a device.

Huge thanks to @bmos for creating the issue form & automations for adding new devices.

Thanks to everyone who has submitted devices to the library.
