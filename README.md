Integration to add battery notes to a device, with automatic discovery via a growing battery library for devices

*Please :star: this repo if you find it useful*

**This integration will set up the following platforms.**

Platform | Description
-- | --
`sensor` | Show battery type.

## Installation

### HACS

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=andrew-codechimp&repository=HA-Battery-Notes&category=Integration)

Or
Search for `Battery Notes` in HACS and install it under the "Integrations" category.


Restart Home Assistant

**Important**

Add the following entry to your `configuration.yaml`
```
battery_notes:
```
Restart Home Assistant a final time
In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "Battery Notes"

### Manual Installation

Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `battery_notes`.
Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/battery_notes/` directory (folder) in this repository.
Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
Restart Home Assistant
Add the following entry to your `configuration.yaml`
```
battery_notes:
```
Restart Home Assistant a final time
In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "Battery Notes"


## Configuration is done in the UI

On the "Configuration" -> "Integrations" -> "Battery Notes" screen add a new device, pick your device with a battery and add the battery type.
The battery type will then be displayed as a diagnostic sensor on the device.

## FAQ's

* When is the library updated?  
It updates when Home Assistant is restarted and approximately every 24 hours after that.  
It will pull the latest devices that have been merged into the main branch, if you have recently submitted a pull request for a new device it will not appear until it has been manually reviewed and merged.

* How do I remove a battery note on a device?  
Go into the Settings -> Integrations -> Battery Notes, use the menu on the right of a device and select Delete, this will only delete the battery note, not the whole device.

* Why does the device icon change?  
Unfortunately where there are multiple integrations associated with a device Home Assistant seems to choose an icon at random, I have no control over this.

* Can I edit a battery note?  
Go into Settings -> Integrations -> Battery Notes and click Configure on the device you want to edit.

## Automatic discovery

Battery Notes will automatically discover devices (as long as you have followed the installation instructions above) that it has in its library and create a notification to add a battery note.
![Discovery](https://github.com/andrew-codechimp/HA-Battery-Notes/blob/main/images/screenshot-discovery.png "Device Discovery")

If you wish to disable this functionality then change your `configuration.yaml` to set enable_autodiscovery to false
```
battery_notes:
  enable_autodiscovery: false
```

## Contributing to the Battery Library

<!-- To add a device definition to the battery library so that it will be automatically configured there are two options:

### Submit Definition via GitHub Issues Form

To add a new device via GitHub Issues, fill out [this form (BETA)](https://github.com/andrew-codechimp/HA-Battery-Notes/issues/new?template=new_device_request.yml&title=[Device]%3A+).
Upon submission of the issue, GitHub will attempt to make the required code changes automatically.

### Submit Definition via Pull Request

If you have issues with the form, or if you feel more comfortable editing JSON data, you can directly add definitions to [the library.json file](custom_components/battery_notes/data/library.json). -->
Fork the repository, add your device details to the JSON document `custom_components/battery_notes/data/library.json`, and then submit a pull request.

* The manufacturer and model should be exactly what is displayed on the Device screen within Home Assistant.
* The make & model names may be different between integrations such as Zigbee2MQTT and ZHA, if you see a similar device please duplicate the entry rather than changing it.
* Please keep devices in alphabetical order by manufacturer/model.
* The `battery_quantity` data is numeric (no quotes) and optional. If a device only requires a single battery, it should be omitted.
* The `battery_type` data should follow the most common naming for general batteries (ex. AAA, D) and the IEC naming for battery cells according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_battery_sizes) (ex. CR2032, 18650)
* If a device has a bespoke rechargeable battery you can use `"battery_type": "Rechargeable"`
* For devices like smoke alarms where the battery is not replaceable you can use `"battery_type": "Irreplaceable"`

For the example image below, your JSON entry will look like this:

```
{
    "manufacturer": "Philips",
    "model": "Hue motion sensor (9290012607)",
    "battery_type": "AAA",
    "battery_quantity": 2
},
```

## Acknowledgements

A lot of the inspiration for this integration came from the excellent [PowerCalc by bramstroker](https://github.com/bramstroker/homeassistant-powercalc), without adapting code from PowerCalc I'd never have worked out how to add additional sensors to a device.

<!-- Huge thanks to @bmos for creating the issue form & automations for adding new devices. COMING SOON -->

Thanks to everyone who has submitted devices to the library.
