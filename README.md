# Notice

The component and platforms in this repository are not meant to be used by a
user, but as a "blueprint" that custom component developers can build
upon, to make more awesome stuff.

HAVE FUN! 😎

## Why?

This is simple, by having custom_components look (README + structure) the same
it is easier for developers to help each other and for users to start using them.

If you are a developer and you want to add things to this "blueprint" that you think more
developers will have use for, please open a PR to add it :)
